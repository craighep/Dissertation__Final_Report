I am grateful to some fellow students who provided help and support throughout this project, and for the numerous ideas they provided to me to assist with completing certain tasks. Ideas such as breaking down flight manoeuvres into a set of instructions were ones that were used to base my own design and implementation from. No code has been copied or taken and changed from another student. 

I would also like to thank the users who tested the completed application and who provided very vital and useful feedback. Feedback from these users was greatly appreciated and helpful when evaluating the application and project. The quick response to the questionnaires was also highly appreciated, due to the time constraints on the project.

Finally, I would like to thank my project supervisor. The clear sight of requirements has meant that it was possible to begin the project earlier than expected, giving me more time to work on important design and coding of the application. The request from the supervisor to create initial planning and research at the start of the project helped greatly in the overall analysis of the task, and a check-up of project progress mid-way through the project ensured I did not fall behind or have any substantial issues.
